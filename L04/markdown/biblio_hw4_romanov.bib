	abstract = {Summary There have been many images of experiment. The contemplative narratives of Aristotle served to illustrate hypotheses and arguments. There was no expectation that they be performed. Even in Galileo's dialogues, the distinction between real experiments and imaginary ones is not sharp (see galileo). During the seventeenth century, performance and public description became essential to the probative power of experiment. These made its methods and procedures transparent, allowing any reader of the narrative to be a virtual witness of an active demonstration (Shapin and Schaffer 1985, pp. 22?79). Thus, by the end of the scientific revolution, illustrative narratives were distinguished from public accounts of experiment as the disciplined, systematic study of phenomena. Eventually this made the efficacy of thought experiments problematic (see Kuhn 1977, pp. 241?2, and thought experiments). As a source of experience of realms previously beyond the reach of the senses, real?world experiment contributed to the rise of objective scientific knowledge. Harvey, Galileo, Hooks, Boyle, Newton, and other proponents of experimental natural philosophy established an important new mode of argumentation.},

When a question leads to confused, inconsistent answers, this may be (1) because the question is ultimately meaningless or at least unanswerable, but it may also be (2) because an adequate answer requires a powerful analytical apparatus. My view is that many important questions about relation between mind and brain are of this latter kind, and that some of the necessary technical and conceptual tools are becoming available as a result of work on he problems of making computer programs behave intelligently. In this paper we suggest a theory of why introspection does not give clear answers to these questions. The paper does not go very far toward finding technical solutions to the questions, but there is probably some value in finding at least a clear explanation of why we are confused.},

	edition = {Winter 2019},
	title = {Thought {Experiments}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2019/entrieshought-experiment/},
	abstract = {Thought experiments are basically devices of the imagination. They areemployed for various purposes such an entertainment, education,conceptual analysis, exploration, hypothesizing, theory selection,theory implementation, etc. Some applications are more controversialthan others. Few would object to thought experiments that serve toillustrate complex states of affairs, or those that are used ineducational contexts. The situation is different, however, withrespect to the appropriation of imagined scenarios to investigatereality (very broadly conceived to include things like electrons,tables, rain, beliefs, morals, people, numbers, universes, and evendivine beings). It is this use of thought experiments that attractsmost of the attention inside and outside of philosophical discourse.Significant is the overlap here with many other central philosophicaltopics, such as the nature of the imagination, the importance ofunderstanding in contrast to explanation, the role of intuition inhuman cognition, and the relationship between fiction and truth.Moreover, thought experiments are interdisciplinary in two importantrespects. Firstly, not only philosophers treat them as a topic, butalso historians, cognitive scientists, psychologists, etc. Secondly,they can be found in many disciplines, including biology, economics,history, mathematics, philosophy, and physics (although,interestingly, not with the same frequency in each)., Most often thought experiments are communicated in narrative form,frequently with diagrams. It is important to distinguish between theimagined scenarios that are featured in thought experiments, on theone hand, and the narratives that establish the scenarios inpeople’s mind, on the other. Once a scenario is imagined it mayassume a life on its own, and this explains partly the creative powerof a good thought experiment. Experimental results may obtain thatactually run counter to the narrative that initiated the discussion ofan imagined scenario. Besides, thought experiments should bedistinguished from thinking about experiments, from merely imaginingany experiments to be conducted outside the imagination, and frompsychological experiments with thoughts, though there may be someoverlap. They should also be distinguished from counterfactualreasoning in general, as they seem to require an experimental element(i.e., visualized, touched, heard, etc.), which explains theimpression that something is experienced in a thought experiment(Brown 1991 [2011]). In other words, though many call anycounterfactual or hypothetical situation a thought experiment (see,e.g., Rescher 1991), this appears too encompassing. It is a quitedifferent matter as to whether there is a logical structure common toall of thought experiments. Based on considerations of logicalstructure, a taxonomy has been proposed according to which all thoughtexperiments fall into two classes: “Necessity Refuters”and “Possibility Refuters” (see Sorensen 1990,132–160). Such proposals especially fuel the debate aboutidentity conditions of thought experiments. What modifications tological structure does a thought experiment tolerate before it ceasesto exist and a new one is born? In other words, how much emphasis onpropositional characteristics in appropriate is the analysis ofthought experiments?, Looking at the development of the discussion about thought experimentsover the past thirty years, it is fair to say that thought experimentswere primarily an important topic in the philosophy of science and thephilosophy of philosophy (“metaphilosophy”), before thescope widened up at a later point. There is a simple reason for thatpath. At the core of the discussion sits a relatively simpleepistemological challenge that is presented in a particularly powerfulmanner by numerous thought experiments that the history of science hasto offer. They suggest that we can learn about the real world byvirtue of merely thinking about imagined scenarios. But how can welearn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking in such away? Are there really thought experiments that enable us to acquirenew knowledge about nature without new empirical data? If so, wheredoes the new information come from if not from contact with the realmof investigation under consideration in an imagined scenario? Finally,how can we distinguish good from bad instances of thought experiments?These questions seem urgent with respect to scientific thoughtexperiments, because many “recognize them as an occasionallypotent tool for increasing our understanding of nature.…Historically their role is very close to the double one played byactual laboratory experiments and observations. First, thoughtexperiments can disclose nature’s failure to conform to a previouslyheld set of expectations. Second, they can suggest particular ways inwhich both expectation and theory must henceforth be revised.”(Kuhn 1977, p. 241 and 261) The questions surrounding theepistemological challenge that certain scientific thought experimentspose are also urgent regarding thought experiments outside of thesciences. This is especially true with respect to philosophy itself.Philosophy offers numerous examples of thought experiments that play arole similar in importance to some scientific thought experiments. Andthis fact provokes in turn further inquiries into the relationshipbetween the sciences and philosophy, especially with respect tophenomena that implicate both the sciences and philosophy, such as themind (see Wilkes 1988; Young 2013).,  If scientific practice has room for thought experiments, then thequestion arises as to why we would want philosophical methodology tobe more discriminatory in this respect. One reason that is oftenoffered is that results of scientific thought experiments may besubjected to further empirical testing. This can’t be done forphilosophical thought experiments. It seems difficult to accept such acategorical separation of science and philosophy. The 17th century sawsome of the most brilliant practitioners of thought experimentation inGalileo, Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz, all of whom pursued theproject of “natural philosophy.” And in our own time, thecreation of quantum mechanics and relativity are almost unthinkablewithout the crucial role played by thought experiments, most of whichrelate to important philosophical issues that arise from thesescientific theories. Besides, much of ethics, philosophy of language,and philosophy of mind is based on the results of thought experimentsin a way that seems very similar to scientific thought experiments(though some might contest this), including Searle’s Chinese room,Putnam’s twin earth, and Jackson’s Mary the colourscientist. Philosophy, even more than the sciences, would be severelyimpoverished without thought experiments. These observations partlyexplain why it has been argued that a more “unified” account ofthought experiments is desirable (see Boniolo 1997; Cooper 2005,pp. 329–330; Gähde 2000). Of course, it is important not todownplay the significant differences between the sciences andphilosophy. But an account of thought experiments seems more powerfulif it can do justice to the fact that not only in the sciences we findmany of them., There have been several attempts to define “thoughtexperiment” along the lines of traditional conceptual analysis(see, e.g., Picha 2011; McComb 2013), but likely it will be better toleave the term loosely characterized, so as not to prejudice theongoing investigation. Of course, we need to have some idea as to whatthought experiments are to guide a proper philosophical analysis (seeHäggqvist 2009), but this does not mean that we need to beginwith a technical definition, specifying necessary and sufficientconditions. In fact, many of the most important concepts we deal withremain rather loosely defined when philosophical inquiry begins, e.g.,religion or democracy. Luckily, there are plenty of examples to referto in order to circumscribe our subject matter well enough. As well asthose already mentioned, there are Newton’s bucket, Heisenberg’sgamma-ray microscope, Einstein’s elevator, Leibniz’s mill, Parfit’speople who split like amoebas, and Thomson’s violinist. Everyone isprobably familiar with some of these. Less familiar thoughtexperiments include the mouse that breaks into the tabernacle of amedieval Roman Catholic Church building to feed on the consecratedwafers in there (see Fehige 2011). Roman Catholic Christians believethat a consecrated wafer is the body of Christ. The “substance” of thewafer, understood in terms of Aristotelian categories, is believed tobe replaced. In its place is the “substance” of Christ’s body afterconsecration by a priest. Only the Aristotelian “accidents” of thewafer remain intact (smell, colour, texture, etc.). Does the mouse eatthe body of Christ (if any human actually does)? Another example is“the dome”which is to prove indeterminism in Newtonianphysics. Imagine a mass sitting on a radially symmetric surface in agravitational field. Guided by Newton’s laws of motion one comes torealize that the mass can either remain at rest for all times, orspontaneously move in an arbitrary direction (see Norton 2008). Thisthought experiment triggers a number of very interesting questionsconcerning the nature of Newtonian theory, the meaning of“physical”, and the role of idealizations in physics. And,of course, does it show what it claims? (see Malament 2008)., In the following we will first provide a characterization of thoughtexperiments in light of examples. A proposal follows for classifyingthought experiments, before reviewing the state of the debate onthought experiments as such, preceded by some remarks about thehistory of philosophical inquiry into the nature of thoughtexperiments. We conclude by highlighting some trends in discussionssurrounding the so-called laboratory of the mind.},

	abstract = {Taking Brian Cantwell Smith's study, "Limits of Correctness in Computers," as its point of departure, this article explores the role of models in computer science. Smith identifies two kinds of models that play an important role, where specifications are models of problems and programs are models of possible solutions. Both presuppose the existence of conceptualizations as ways of conceiving the world "in certain delimited ways." But high-level programming languages also function as models of virtual (or abstract) machines, while low-level programming languages function as models of causal (or physical) machines. The resulting account suggests that sets of models embedded within models are indispensable for computer programming.},

	abstract = {Analogy has a rich history in Western civilization. Over the centuries, it has become reified in that analogical reasoning has sometimes been regarded as a fundamental cognitive process. In addition, it has become identified with a particular expressive format. The limitations of the modern view are illustrated by monster analogies, which show that analogy need not be regarded as something having a single form, format, or semantics. Analogy clearly does depend on the human ability to create and use well-defined or analytic formats for laying out propositions that express or imply meanings and perceptions. Beyond this dependence, research in cognitive science suggests that analogy relies on a number of genuinely fundamental cognitive capabilities, including semantic flexibility, the perception of resemblances and of distinctions, imagination, and metaphor. Extant symbolic models of analogical reasoning have various sorts of limitation, yet each model presents some important insights and plausible mechanisms. I argue that future efforts could be aimed at integration. This aim would include the incorporation of contextual information, the construction of semantic bases that are dynamic and knowledge rich, and the incorporation of multiple approaches to the problems of inference constraint.},

	abstract = {How do pictures work? How are they able to represent what they do? A picture of a goat, for example, is a flat surface covered with marks, yet it depicts a goat, chewing straw, while standing on a hillock. The puzzle of depiction is to understand how the flat marks can do this.
            Language poses a similar problem. A written description of a goat will also be a collection of marks on a flat surface, which none the less represent that animal. In the case of language the solution clearly has something to do with the arbitrary way we use those marks. The word ‘leg’, for example, is applied to legs, but any other mark would do as well, providing we all use it in the same way. In the case of pictures, however, something different seems to be going on. There is not the same freedom in producing a picture of a goat on a hillock chewing straw – the surface must be marked in the right way, a way we are not free to choose. So what is the right way?
            A helpful thought is that the surface must be marked so as to let us experience it in a special way. With the description, we merely need to know what the words it contains are used to stand for. With the picture, we must instead be able to see a goat in it. However, although this does seem right, it is difficult to make clear. After all, we do not see a goat in the same way that we see a horse in a view from a window. For one thing, there is no goat there to be seen. For another, it is not even true that looking at the picture is like looking at a goat. It is partly because of the differences that, as we look at the picture, we are always aware that it is merely a collection of marks on a flat surface. So what is this special experience, seeing a goat in the picture? This is the question that a philosophical account of depiction must try to answer.},

Three of the central models in contemporary research programs are the Attention-Spotlight metaphor, the Attention As Limited Resource metaphor, and the Biased-Competition metaphor. Each of these metaphoric models involves a specific ontology of entities and processes, and each one entails a specific set of values that guide research on attention. These values are largely incompatible across the three different models. I argue that metaphor-based value systems are characteristic of all science and that this is not a lamentable problem, but rather the source of the insight and experimental fruitfulness of scientific models.},

Model aeroplanes and other scale models share selected structural properties with their originals, while differing in other properties, such as construction materials and size. Analogue models, which resemble their originals in some aspect of structure or internal relations, are important in the sciences, because they can facilitate inferences about complicated or obscure natural systems. A collection of billiard balls in random motion is an analogue model of an ideal gas; the interactions and motions of the billiard balls are taken to represent – to be analogous to – the interactions and motions of molecules in the gas.
            In mathematical logic, a model is a structure – an arrangement of objects – which represents a theory expressed as a set of sentences. The various terms of the sentences of the theory are mapped onto objects and their relations in the structure; a model is a structure that makes all of the sentences in the theory true. This specialized notion of model has been adopted by philosophers of science; on a ‘structuralist’ or ‘semantic’ conception, scientific theories are understood as structures which are used to represent real systems in nature. Philosophical debates have arisen regarding the precise extent of the resemblances between scientific models and the natural systems they represent.},

	abstract = {The volume is based on the papers that were presented at the Interna­ tional Conference Model-Based Reasoning in Scientific Discovery (MBR'98), held at the Collegio Ghislieri, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy, in December 1998. The papers explore how scientific thinking uses models and explanatory reasoning to produce creative changes in theories and concepts. The study of diagnostic, visual, spatial, analogical, and temporal rea­ soning has demonstrated that there are many ways of performing intelligent and creative reasoning that cannot be described with the help only of tradi­ tional notions of reasoning such as classical logic. Traditional accounts of scientific reasoning have restricted the notion of reasoning primarily to de­ ductive and inductive arguments. Understanding the contribution of model­ ing practices to discovery and conceptual change in science requires ex­ panding scientific reasoning to include complex forms of creative reasoning that are not always successful and can lead to incorrect solutions. The study of these heuristic ways of reasoning is situated at the crossroads of philoso­ phy, artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, and logic; that is, at the heart of cognitive science. There are several key ingredients common to the various forms of model­ based reasoning to be considered in this book. The models are intended as in­ terpretations of target physical systems, processes, phenomena, or situations. The models are retrieved or constructed on the basis of potentially satisfying salient constraints of the target domain.},

	abstract = {Experiment, as a specific category of scientific activity, did not emerge until the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century. Seen primarily as an arbiter in theory choice, there was little, if any, analysis of experimental techniques or, the ways in which data become transformed into established facts. Philosophical analysis of experiment was typically simplistic, focusing on the role of observation alone as the foundation for experimental facts. This was challenged by Thomas Kuhn who stressed the importance of background theory and beliefs in all perception, including (its role in) scientific experiment. This interconnection between theory and experiment severely undermined the idea that experiment could stand as an independent and objective criterion for judging the merits of one theory over another.
            In the 1980s new philosophical analyses of experiment began to emerge, emphasizing the ways in which experiment could be seen to have a life of its own embodying activities that could supposedly be understood without recourse to theory. Factors important in the evaluation of experimental results as well as the ways in which laboratory science differs from its theoretical counterpart became the focus for a new history and philosophy of experiment. Consequently, further debates arose regarding the relationship of experiment to theory, and whether it is possible to provide a methodological framework within which experimental practice can be evaluated.},

On this view, the acceptability of a hypothesis cannot be discounted by criticizing the foundational analogy. Yet scientists commonly appear to level exactly this sort of criticism. If scientists are able to discount the acceptability of analogical hypotheses in this way, then the logical empiricist view is mistaken. I analyze four forms of analogy counterargument, disanalogy, misanalogy, counteranalogy, and false analogy, with examples from the debate over the asteroid impact hypothesis. These counterarguments do address the acceptability of analogical hypotheses, indicating that analogies can confer acceptability, confirmation notwithstanding.},
